Chip8 Emulator

To use: 

Step 1: download the chip8.exe file in the build folder \
Step 2: ./chip8.exe (size of window) (cycle speed) (.ch8 file of ROM)

Improvements: \
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Separate stuff into different .cpp and .h files for clarity \
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Use OpenGL for GPU Acceleration? (not necessary, but would be cool) \
